2020 Dark Photon UROP

Includes mass calibration for the dimuon spectrum, a simultaneous fit of all resonances in the dimuon range, widths plotted vs mass to inspect detector resolution

Includes mass dependence study, correcting the mass distribution for an eta and pt dependence, compares the width of a corrected and uncorrected mass distributin for jpsi, phi, and upsilon resonances

Includes acceptance study, using monte carlo data to calculate the ratio of existing particles to particles detected from 0.5-10 GeV
